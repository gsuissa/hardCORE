# hardCORE
`hardCORE` is a package that implements the model of [Suissa et. al 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.476.2613S/abstract). It calculates the minimum, maximum, and marginal core radius fractions (CRFmin, CRFmax, CRFmarg) for a solid exoplanet using only its mass and radius.

This package was used to [constrain core sizes of the TRAPPIST-1 planets](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018RNAAS...2...31S/abstract).
